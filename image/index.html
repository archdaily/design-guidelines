	<h3 class="title-section">1.1. Format</h3>
	<h4 class="title-secondary">1.1.1. JPG</h4>
	<p>Images with complex gradients as a portrait or a landscape have a better compression on this format. To have a perseption of faster launch of the image use progressive compression and save the images with a quality between 70% and 90% trying to don't lose color richness.</p>

		<li><strong>Format: </strong>JPG</li>
		<li><strong>Compression: </strong>Progressive</li>
		<li><strong>Quality: </strong>70% - 90%</li>
		<li><strong>Usage: </strong>Complex bitmaps</li>

	<h4 class="title-secondary">1.1.2. PNG</h4>
	<p>Your image have transparency? This is your format. Think on this especially to every icon or logo. This kind of assets have to work over any background color and this is the reason to use png 32 or png 24 to those images. Less colors, less bits and less weight. GIF also works fine with transparency and icons with basic colors, but dont save fine the gradients. PNG use interlaced save option to render with a progressive compression.</p>

	<h4 class="title-secondary">1.1.3. GIF</h4>
	<p>Images with animations save it on GIF format. You have to be careful of the color quality.</p>

	<h3 class="title-section">1.2. Optimization</h3>
	If you work on OS X use <a href="https://imageoptim.com/">ImageOptim</a> to remove junk metadata and unnecessary <a href="https://imageoptim.com/color-profiles.html">color profiles</a> from all the images you use.

	<h3 class="title-section">1.3. Icons and sprites</h3>
	<h4 class="title-secondary">1.3.1. Icons</h4>
	<p>Take care of create icons with perfect shapes. Some times you create an icon where the shape dont have an exact with or height, or maybe you make a resize to a shape with an impar with or heigth, that create half pixels on the border of the shape. Obviously, half pixels can't be rendered on devices with a pixel ratio of 1. So, with that we have a new entire pixel on the border but with same color but with the half opacity. Avoid that!!!</p>

	<p>Icons have to be saved on png format, with transparent background and with trimed on the border of the shape like the following image shows.</p>

	<p>Create first a image on the double size to retina devises display and then resize it to the half. You will need both files.</p>
