<p>Our grid system is composed by a container with the class ".afd-grids" and inside it each column has two classes: One generic that is called ".afd-grids__col" and other one that indicate us what fraction of the width is going to be filled by the column. To naming it we use a BEM modiffier with a fraction (eg: .afd-grids__col--1-2 for half of total width), changing the slash (/) of the fraction by a dash (-). Here is an example of the markup:</p>

{% highlight html %}

<div class="afd-grid">
  <div class="afd-grid__col afd-grid__col--1-2">One half</div>
  <div class="afd-grid__col afd-grid__col--1-2">The other half</div>
</div>

{% endhighlight %}

  <h3>Here you have a visual example:</h3>

  <div class="afd-grid">
    <div class="afd-grid__col afd-grid__col--1-1">.afd-grid__col--1-1 (1/1)</div>

<h2 class="title-primary">Nested grids</h2>
<p>Also you can nested a grid inside other one adding the class ".afd-grid" to the column where you are going to nested new columns and the following code shows you an example of it</p>

{% highlight html %}
  <div class="afd-grid">
    <div class="afd-grid__col afd-grid__col--2-5">Two fifths</div>
    <div class="afd-grid__col afd-grid__col--3-5 afd-grid">
      <div class="afd-grid__col afd-grid__col--1-2">One half</div>
      <div class="afd-grid__col afd-grid__col--1-2">One half</div>
    </div>
  </div>
{% endhighlight %}
