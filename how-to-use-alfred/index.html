title:  "How to use Alfred"

<p>Alfred is a colection of endpoints with UI components to use in your application. There are endpoints with html, css and js and these are the aviables endpoints so far:</p>

{% highlight ruby %}
"http://alfred.dyn.archdaily.com/#{site}/header?format=home" # For the home header (logo inside an h1)
"http://alfred.dyn.archdaily.com/#{site}/header" # For the complete header 
"http://alfred.dyn.archdaily.com/#{site}/header?format=only-nav" # For the navigation bar alone
"http://alfred.dyn.archdaily.com/#{site}/header?format=nft" # With the NFT search aviable
"http://alfred.dyn.archdaily.com/#{site}/header?format=contact-links" # For the links that are at the end of the fixed sidebar
"http://alfred.dyn.archdaily.com/#{site}/footer?format=clean" # For the footer without partners carousel
"http://alfred.dyn.archdaily.com/#{site}/footer" # For the footer
"http://alfred.dyn.archdaily.com/alfred.css" # For the styles
"http://alfred.dyn.archdaily.com/alfred.js" # For the javascripts
{% endhighlight %}

<p>To use those components in your app you have to paste them in your code as raw. In Ruby on Rails we do this instantiating the endpoints as a variable in our Application Controller. Something similar like this (In the example the cach√© has been obviated):</p>

{% highlight ruby %}

before_action :load_afd

def load_afd
  @afd_header = open("alfred.dyn.archdaily.com/#{site}/header").read
end

{% endhighlight %}

<p>Then you can put your variable wherever you whant to use the code</p>

{% highlight erb %}
<!-- To paste HTML -->
<%= raw @afd_header %>
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight erb %}
<!-- Paste CSS. We prefere to put the styles raw inside the head to minimize the number of requests and get a faster render and painting of the layout. Plus, you need to force the encoding. -->
<style>
  <%= raw(@afd_css.force_encoding('utf-8')) %>
</style>
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight erb %}
<!-- Paste JavaScript. Like in CSS, we put it raw in the code, but at the end of the document to avoid blocking the render. Here we force the encoding too. -->
<script>
  <%= raw(@afd_js.force_encoding('utf-8')) %>
</script>
{% endhighlight %}
